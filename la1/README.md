## Overview

The goal of this homework is to write and fully demonstrate a Scheme function that 
implements a Tree Search And Replace operation. The function name is tsar, and has 
the interface:
		(tsar subj srch repl)

## Compiling and Using

From the directory containing all source files, the scheme program can be compiled 
and run from the command line using the command:
$ ./tsar.scm


## Results 

Test cases for the tsar function implementation are included in the tsar.scm file 
and can be displayed on screen by uncommenting the lines of code.
