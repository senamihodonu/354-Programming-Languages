## Overview

This purpose of this assignment is to begin using an object-oriented imperative 
programming language named Smalltalk, which is more object oriented than Java 
or C++. To demonstrate this a simple banking application will be ported from Java 
to Smalltalk. In Smalltalk, everything is an object. Smalltalk was designed by Alan 
Kay, Dan Ingalls, and Adele Goldberg, at Xerox PARC, in 1972.
